## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark charcoal (#222222) to establish a sophisticated dark theme. The original user requested a dark palette, which this achieves.
- Primary color: Electric purple (#BF5FFF) to contrast with the background and provide visual pop. Its hue comes from a point about 30 degrees to the left of blue, for a slightly more exciting color that contrasts against the dark background.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#D0BFFF) to complement the primary color and add highlights to interactive elements. Its hue is about 30 degrees to the left of purple, further differentiating it from the primary color.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for headlines and short amounts of body text to ensure a bold, modern aesthetic as requested by the original user.
- Implement a split-screen layout with a vertical navigation bar on the left and page content on the right.
- Incorporate rounded corners and a Gaussian blur/transparent look for certain elements as specified in the prompt.
- Apply subtle animations to sliding cards in the projects section for an engaging user experience.
